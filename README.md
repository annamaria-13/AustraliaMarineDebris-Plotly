# AustraliaMarineDebris-Plotly
Coastal clean up plots with the Australian Marine Debris Database (ADMI) using Plotly

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

1.	Check out the coastal cleanup metrics reported on AMDI dashboard  Australian Marine Debris Database - Reporting Dashboard (tangaroablue.org) (Signup Required to access the dashboard), and have a play around with the different interactive graphs

2.	Using the coastal cleanup data recorded by Ocean Conservancy (see attached spreadsheet), try to recreate some or all of the graphs from the AMDI dashboard. Note that weâ€™re using data collected by Ocean Conservancy instead of AMDI because AMDI does not make available all the coastal cleanup data which they collect from across the country.

3.	Figure out if thereâ€™s better ways to visualise certain data (pie charts instead of bar charts for categorical data, stacked plots instead of lists for top 10 items, maps instead of clustered bar charts for number of clean-ups by state) and try making these graphs

4.	Once youâ€™ve done the above, come back and weâ€™ll have a chat about posting these visualisations on Datapane ðŸ˜Š

Ultimately the goal for this exercise is to produce intuitive and interactable visualisations on coastal cleanups and publish it on an open platform like Datapane, as opposed to the AMDI dashboard which currently requires you to sign up on their website to view the cleanup metrics.
